# Micro-Project
Hey there! This repository contains the micro projects that I am making using pure HTML and CSS without any frameworks. These projects help me in improving my fundamental conceptual knowledge of CSS that I feel is mandatory for a longer run.
I know these things can be done immediately by using Bootstrap but doing so in my learning phase will definitely be not a wise decision.
